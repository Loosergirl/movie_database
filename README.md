# movie_database
A variation of the revealing module pattern is used. It is basically the same as the standard revealing module pattern, but I have chosen to use unique names for my functions. In my opinion, the revealing module pattern is still followed but other people may not agree.

So far I have only added a basic constructor. Obviously, this part of the code isn't finished. It is impossible to create new movies, rate movies, or bring out the movie with the highest or lowest rating even though corresponding functions exist in my `moviedatabase` object. 

Worse, I still haven't been able to print out a list of the movies by genre. And the printing out of movies by popularity won't work more than once. I have no clue why; please tell me.

The CSS is really ugly as well.
