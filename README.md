# movie_database
A variation of the revealing module pattern is used. It is basically the same as the standard revealing module pattern, but I have chosen to use unique names for my functions. In my opinion, the revealing module pattern is still followed but other people may not agree.

Some of the functions are currently not available in the interface, even though they exist.

The CSS is really ugly as well.
